Smoothed Quadratic Energies on Meshes
-------------------------------------
ACM Transactions on Graphics 2014 - J. Martinez Esturo, C. RÃ¶ssl, and H. Theisel

This repository contains a reference implementation of the generic *smoothed
energy regularizer for quadratic energies on triangular meshes* proposed in
this [paper].

MATLAB Demo Implementation
--------------------------
The energy regularization reference implementation is given in
`TriSystemSmoothEnergy.m`.

As an example application, we provide a demo of interactive 2D deformations the
minimize the ARAP, lARAP, and ASAP energies.

Usage
-----
Clone the reposityory with
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/ph03/smoothed-energy-regularization`.

Run the `demo_2d.m` file in matlab to start.

Requirements
------------
A recent Matlab version with object-oriented language features is required. We
have tested the code on both Windows and Linux machines with Matlab versions
r2012a and r2013a.

Credits
-------
We link the sources of the Eigen library (see [Eigen]) as a submodule to
efficiently compute polardecompositions of deformation gradients.

The code makes use of Matlab functions by Alec Jacobson (see [gptoolbox]) for
mesh loading.
